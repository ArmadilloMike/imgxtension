I have only so far tested this on Brave and Chrome, it should run on most Chromium based browsers. First, once the file is unzipped, go to 
chrome://extensions/

Next, there should somewhere be a switch on the screen that says “Developer Mode”. Make sure that is checked to the ON position.

Multiple buttons should appear if it was unchecked. Click “Load Unpacked”. Then, navigate through your file manager window that pops up to find the unzipped “imgflip” folder. Click it, then select “Select Folder”. Your browser should have the extension successfully installed. Keep in mind this may not work on mobile browsers, but it may on Google Chrome for Mobile and Kiwi. (Untested)
